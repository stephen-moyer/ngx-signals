  <p>
    Similar to observableEffect, but takes a "key" signal that is passed to the
    observable function. The observable returned from the function has
    "shareReplay" from rxjs applied, then cached using the value of the "key"
    signal. If the "key" signal changes, and there is an observable in the cache
    for the "key" signal value, the cached observable will be returned to
    "observableEffect". Notice how going backwards loads with no delay, because
    the observable is cached. Calling load also returns instantly because the
    key is in the cache already.

  <pre>
    <code>
    readonly dependency = signal(1);
    readonly example = observableEffectCache(this.dependency, (depVal) => of(depVal).pipe(delay(1000)));
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    dependency: {{ dependency() }} (<a
      href="javascript:;"
      (click)="increment(dependency)"
      >increment</a
    >, <a href="javascript:;" (click)="decrement(dependency)">decrement</a>,
    <a href="javascript:;" (click)="example.clearCache(true)"
      >clear cache and reload</a
    >)
  </p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>See <a routerLink="/observable-effect">observableEffect</a></p>
  <p>
    There are methods on the value returned by observableEffectCache to clear
    and remove keys from the cache.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also options you can pass to observableEffectCache to control what
    gets cached and if errors should be cached. You can also change the hash
    function used for hashing the key value (the default is JSON.stringify).
